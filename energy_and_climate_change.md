- we are approaching 400ppm $$$CO_2$$$, which is 120ppm higher than the last peak in the past 640,000 years
- Ice sheets extend closer to equator when $$$CO_2$$$ is lower and do not exist when it is higher
- The melting of sea ice does not cause sea levels to rise because the volume of water displaced actually grows smaller
- When the oceans are warmed, the water expands (albeit by a little bit)
