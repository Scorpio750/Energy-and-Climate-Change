## Climate and Shit

- Global Temperature Anomaly has steadily increased since 1880
	- In meterological terms, **anomaly** refers to deviation from the mean
	
### What is Climate?

- Not weather
	- Weather refers to a snapshot of what's going on at a particular time
	- Climate is the synthesis of weather, including averages, extremes, and variations
	
### Earth's Energy Balance: Regulator of Global Climate

- Earth is heated by sunlight that is absorbed by its surface and atmosphere
- Earth is cooled by outgoing infrared energy

## 9/17/14

- we are approaching 400ppm $$$CO_2$$$, which is 120ppm higher than the last peak in the past 640,000 years
- Ice sheets extend closer to equator when $$$CO_2$$$ is lower and do not exist when it is higher
- The melting of sea ice does not cause sea levels to rise because the volume of water displaced actually grows smaller

- When the oceans are warmed, the water expands (albeit by a little bit)

## Physics and Shit

- Sun emits light like a black body with a temperature of 5780K, and energy emission of 63 mil W/m$$$^2$$$.
- The Earth reflects about 30% of the energy flux from the sun
- If we assume that Earth is a black body radiator, the temperature should be  255K (0F)
- Temperature of space is -270C, minimum value predicted on "dark side" of planets
- Most of the energy from the sun is absorbed by the ground and the oceans and diffused throughout - *thermalized*

### Solar Energy

- Solar energy require a lot of other electronics to convert the 1.5V D/C into 120V A/C.
	- Problem is solar also only works well for a few hours a day

### Thermodynamics

- 2nd Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy increases in a closed system) means that an engine cannot operate at 100% efficiency
- Gasoline engine is around 25-30%, diesel is around 40%
- The efficiency of a heat engine is limited by the range of operating temperatures

## Do Isomers Matter?

- Octanes are high-energy
	- All octanes have essentially the same energy
	- High/low octane difference is the same shit
- Branched alkanes are more resistant to detonation without a spark. More branched = higher octane #
- "Otto" engine is what gasoline engines are. 
- Diesel has a cetane rating
- n-alkanes are more clean-burning, high-efficiency fuel
